# Unity Model Training

Welcome to my AI-driven Unity game! This project was built using Unityâ€™s ML-Agents toolkit, which allows developers to train and embed machine learning models directly within their Unity games. If you're interested in diving deeper into ML-Agents, check out the official [Unity ML-Agents Toolkit](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) on GitHub.

## About the Project
The game features a [describe key elements of your game, e.g., AI-controlled character, environment, etc.]. The AI was trained using reinforcement learning techniques provided by ML-Agents. Through multiple training sessions, the agent learned to [describe what your AI does in the game, e.g., navigate obstacles, make strategic decisions, etc.].

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by [Code Monkey](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeMonkeyUnity) video that really got me excited about integrating AI into Unity games. You can check out the video here: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPFU30tbyKs).

## How to Run
To get the game up and running, you'll need to clone this repository and open it with Unity. Make sure you have the ML-Agents package installed. You must launch the ML-Agents in the console, like this: 

```mlagents-learn --run-id=Test3```
 
After that, play the game and watch the AI learning!


You can follow the [ML-Agents installation guide](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/main/docs/Installation.md) if you haven't done so already.
